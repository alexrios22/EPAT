    "The range of possible results in a casino game grows exponentially both with:\n",
    "* The amount of wagers \"$N_{w}$\" in which the gambler <u>sequentially</u> takes part. (betting rounds)\n",

    "\n",
    "So does for the trader that trades a <u>sequence</u> of successive trades in <u>simultaneous</u> trading methodologies. We will use a \"``list``\" for specifying the nature of the different games \"$g$\" that are being played at the same time. Each element will be a \"``pandas.DataFrame``\" with \"$N_{r}$\" rows, one for each possible result \"$r$\" in a wager. (<u>examples</u>: win, lose, partial win, partial lose, break-even, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Two columns, \"``Rates``\" and \"``Probs``\", will describe the profit/loss rate for each result, and its probability, respectively. Needless to say that for each possible \"``Rate``\" in any game, there must be one and only one \"``Prob``\" value between 0 and 1. And they must all add up to zero."

Let also \"$n_{(g;\\;r)} $\" be the amount of wagers that each result \"$r$\" took place. The compound profit \"$P$\" is dictated by:\n",

    "$$ P = \\Pi_{r = 1}^{N_{r}} (1 + X_{(g;\\;r)})^{n_{(g;\\;r)}} \\tag{eq.1} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ \\bar{P} = \\Pi_{r = 1}^{N_{r}} (1 + X_{(g;\\;r)})^{p_{(g;\\;r)}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When an amount of \"$N_{g}$\" games are being played in parallel, the growth rates do not longer come the consequence of a single game \"$g$\" but the sum of all of them. The possible results grow exponentially because they are now the different combinations of the possible outcomes for each single game. Therefore, the probability values in the exponents multiply themselves too:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\bar{P} = \\Pi_{r = 1}^{N_{r}} (1 + \\Sigma_{g = 1}^{N_{g}} X_{(g;\\;r)})^{\\Pi_{g = 1}^{N_{g}} p_{(g;\\;r)}} $$\n",

An easy way to do this is to use the concept \"logarithmic derivative\": when a function like \"$\\bar{P}$\" increases  monotonically in a region of values, function \"$ln\\;\\bar{P}$\" does so too. Then, minima/maxima settle in the exact same points.\n",
